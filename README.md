# react-charts-examples
A collection of examples for charting libraries in React


Each folder contains an example application with some common requirements for charting in React.
The things I am looking for are that it supports:

- Realtime data
- Custom styling
- Animations
- Responsive
- Support & community
- (optional) Small bundle size
